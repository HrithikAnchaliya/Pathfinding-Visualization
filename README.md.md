# Pathfinding Visualization

You can visualize the shortest distance between two node in a grid with Dijkstra's Algorithm and that is the beauty of ***Pathfinding Visualization***

> More Algorithm support is coming.

## Basic Control

 You can only visualize path if you have start node (Green) and end node (Red).

To Create Nodes

 - Click on any node to *'focus'* and Press *S* to create a ***Start Node***
 - Click on any node to *'focus'* and Press *E* to create a ***End Node***
 - Click and drag the left-click mouse button to create  ***Walls***

To Remove Walls

 - Its same as creating the walls (Left click and Drag)

## Settings

To head to the settings, click the ***Settings*** button.

You can also clear the *Grid*  after visualizing the route.

## Diagonal

My Algorithm supports both diagonal and non-diagonal pathfinding.

The Diagonal Option is in the Settings, Which is used to travel in 8-directions which means more accurate  distance between the nodes.

## GO - Crazy

Here's the fun part. You can literally go-crazy with this algorithm, like  create complex wall structure, build a maze to complicate things.
